This extension adds a convenient iNat2Wiki button to iNaturalist observation pages which have photos under Wikimedia-compatible licenses. The button appears under the map and says "Open in iNat2Wiki". It is licensed under the Unlicense. It is available for installation on Firefox [here]([url](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inat2wiki-button/). Enjoy!
